			<p>A word from Parts & Labor
The bulk of our seating is un-reserved, so if you can't make a reservation, please just walk on in!

Parts & Labor, from the team behind Woodberry Kitchen, located in Remington in an old automotive garage, continues the relationship with Chesapeake Bay growers focusing on pastured meats cooked in an open hearth. We pour 24 beers on tap with a focus on supporting small farm breweries in Maryland. Along Howard Street in this space we have a full retail butcher shop selling fresh cuts, sausages, cured meats, and Woodberry Pantry preserves, and staffed with a full butcher team to help make selections.</p>
